### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my personal favorites because I thought it was
    really interesting to see how different parts of the code we wrote contributed
    to such a complex output. Using sin from trigonometry was the part I found most 
    interesting.

* Lab 8

    Another one of my favorites was Lab 8, part 1 because it was the first time
    we were introduced to the ability to read any file. I found this very useful since
    it is commonly used in projects we are building in the future. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite as well because we got familiar with the concept
    of object-oriented programming. I consider this a must know since we are going to use it
    a lot more often in the near future.
